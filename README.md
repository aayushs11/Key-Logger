Simple Keylogger (Python + Tkinter)
-----------------------------------

This is a basic keylogger tool built with Python. It features:

- A clean Tkinter GUI to start and view logs
- Real-time keystroke display in the app window
- Logging of all key presses to a plain text file (key_log.txt)
- "Double ESC" to stop the keylogger safely

How to Use:
-----------
1. Run the script using Python.
2. Click the "Start Logging" button to begin.
3. Keys you press will appear in the window and be saved to 'key_log.txt'.
4. Press ESC twice quickly to stop the logger.
5. Click "Exit" to close the app.

Note:
-----
- Keystrokes are only recorded while logging is active.
- Log history is preserved across sessions.
